MNIST Simple Neural Network Training

**demo.c** is my first simple code that loads a picture and trains weights and biases for that, but iterates only once. 
You can copy and modify this code.

**train.c** is just a finished version of *demo.c* that I will show to the proffesor, so please don't just copy it. 
It additionaly goes through all pictures depending on LoadType.
